Mistakes & Fixes:
Lack of Detail in Job Descriptions

The job descriptions are too vague (e.g., "Managed various projects successfully.").

Fix: Add measurable achievements and specifics.
✅ Example: "Led a team of 10 developers to successfully launch a SaaS platform, reducing processing time by 30%."

Missing Dates for Bachelor's Degree

The resume lists “Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of Los Angeles” but doesn't include graduation years.

Fix: Add the correct time period for clarity.
✅ Example: "Bachelor’s in Computer Science – University of Los Angeles (2012-2016)"

Incomplete Skills Section

The resume mentions "Team Leadership, Communication, Agile Methodology, Docker, Python", but it lacks technical depth.

Fix: Expand it with relevant tools and frameworks.
✅ Example: "React.js, Node.js, SQL, NoSQL, AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, GitHub Actions."

Missing Professional Summary

There's no introduction summarizing experience and expertise.

Fix: Add a brief summary at the top.
✅ Example: "Experienced Project Manager & Web Developer with 5+ years in tech, specializing in Agile development, cloud solutions, and process optimization."

Formatting Issues

The spacing and section organization could be improved for readability.

Fix: Ensure consistent spacing, bullet points, and alignment.
